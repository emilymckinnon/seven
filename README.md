My crowdfunding campaign idea would be to open a late night coffee shop/ venue/ community space with a co-op feel. .The deliverable would be a comfortable and cool shop with a late night twist. it would be like a cool bar but instead of the focus being on alcohol it would be on good food/ espresso/ music/ vibes. 
Three rewards for backing the campaign would be;
#1. A tile on the wall with your name. 
#2. A 20% discount card for campaign contributors.
#3. A quarterly party/ meeting where the contributors would be invited to share their feedback and ideas.
